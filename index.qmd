# Introduction {.unnumbered}

You are looking at a summary code and visualisation for my summer internship. In this internship, I was trying to understand what happens inside the DL model, and how the input image is represented within the model. I worked on two datasets: MNIST (handwritten digits) and atari games (Pong and Space Invaders), and applied dimensionality reduction techniques to understand internal representations of the input.




The documents can be opened both as a HTML website and as a Jupyter notebooks on GitHub.
